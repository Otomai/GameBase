Zombie Defender

This game is a test to see if you can keep the minimum amount of zombies alive from a barage of bullets coming at them.  There

are zombies wandering aroung on one side of the screen in the Zombie Preserve, who are just minding their own buisness, when 

some hunters decide to take some shots at these defenceless zombies.


In a top-down view, you move a shield up and down in between the hunters and the zombies in order to block the shots and 

keep the zombies alive.  Each round has a requirement of keeping a certain number of zombies alive by the end of the time

limit.
