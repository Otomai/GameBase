My game idea is to create a Flappy Bird style endless side scroller game where you as the player will control the character by tapping to make it avoid obstacles that appear on screen. The game will have a scrolling background as you keep moving along in the game. Along with avoiding obstacles it will include the player collecting something to increase their points in the game.
