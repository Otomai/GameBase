Zombie Defender

The game is a test to see if you can keep the minimum amount of zombies alive from a barrage of bullets coming at them. There are zombies wandering around on one side of the screen in the Zombie preserve, who are just minding their own business, when some hunters are taking shots at these defenceless zombies.

In a top-down view, you move a shield up and down in between the hunters and the zombies in order to block the shots and keep the zombies alive. Each round has a requirement of keeping a certain number of zombies alive by the end of the time limit.

10 zombies to start - 3 zombies required to live - 3 minutes
